        Hi, 
    </h1>
    <p>My name is Fawziyyah Oke. My Alt School ID is ALT/SOE/024/0148.</p>
    <p>I am the first child of 4. I am a muslimah. I was born on the 5th of April.
        I am currently on a journey of self-discovery and habit building. I used
        to love challenges but with time I began to develop fears. I would love to 
        change that, hence the reason for joining Alt School. I would love to 
        finally get out of my own head and truly excel. 
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>  
    <p>
        - Challenge myself <br>
        - Master Frontend Engineering
